\title{gmt2geneSet}
\usage{
gmt2geneSet(gmt, termCol = 1, nonGeneCol = termCol,
  singleValue = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmt}{a vector of character values. Each item is a list of words 
comprising a term and its corresponding gene set, which are separated by tab.}

\item{termCol}{an integer value indicating in each item of gmt, which word 
is the term , by default, 1.}

\item{nonGeneCol}{an integer value indicating in each item of gmt, which 
words are not the gene set, by default, termCol.}

\item{singleValue}{a numeric value, which assigns the same value to all 
genes in a given gene set. This is useful when combining together the 
up-regulated gene sets (regularly, singleValue=1) and the down-regulated 
gene sets (regularly, singleValue=-1)}
}
\value{
a data frame, comprising three vectors: term (like pathway names), 
geneset (a gene symbol list separate by comma), and value (either discrete 
or continuous separated by comma)
}
\description{
gmt2geneSet transforms a gmt format file into geneSets.
}
\examples{

# download the gmt file
gmt <- readLines( paste0('http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/CREEDS/download/',
'single_drug_perturbations-v1.0.gmt') ) 

# obtain the index of up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets
index_up <- grep('-up',gmt)
index_down <- grep('-dn',gmt)

# transform the gmt file into gene sets. The gene set is a data frame, 
# comprising three vectors: 
# term (here is drug), geneset (a gene symbol list separate by comma), 
# and value (1 and -1 separate by comma)
gff_up <- gmt2geneSet( gmt[index_up], termCol=c(1,2), singleValue = 1 )
gff_down <- gmt2geneSet( gmt[index_down], termCol=c(1,2), singleValue = -1 )
